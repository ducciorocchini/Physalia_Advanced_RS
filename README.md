# Physalia_Advanced_RS
Advanced Ecological Remote Sensing in R

Daily schedule: 15:00 - 18:00 (Berlin time)


> Overview

The course addresses spatial analysis of remote sensing data, making use of the most important packages in R containing advanced techniques.

By the end of the course, participants will gain proficiency in coding their own analysis workflows and effectively reporting their findings using Markdown and LaTeX. The final part of the course will cover the fundamentals of LaTeX scripting for both articles and presentations.


> Learning outcomes

- Spatio-ecological modelling of remote sensing data

- Proper RS data analysis scripting in GitHub and reporting via Markdown

- Proper reporting in LaTeX for coding texts and output reporting

## Session 2 –  Measuring variability (Tuesday)

- How to measure ecosystem variability in space and time by information theory measures

- Measuring variability via spectral distances

- The rasterdiv R package to couple information theory and spectral distances

## Session 3 – Species distribution modelling with RS based variables (Wednesday)
