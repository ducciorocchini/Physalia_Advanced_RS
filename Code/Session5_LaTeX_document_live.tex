    Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
No one I think is in my tree
I mean, it must be high or low
That is, you can't, you know, tune in, but it's alright
That is, I think it's not too bad
Let me take you down

\section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{The algorithm}
In this paper we riled on the formula of force from Newton represented in Equation \ref{eq:newton}.

\begin{equation}
    t = 2 + n
    \label{eq:time}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    F = \sqrt[3]{G \times \frac{\sqrt{m_{146546}} \times \alpha m_2}{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{10} d^{2646546}}}
    \label{eq:newton}
\end{equation}

The code would sound something like this:
\begin{markdown}
    ``` r
    library(terra)
    obj <- rast("name")
    ```
\end{markdown}

\subsection{Empirical example}

The algorithm was based on the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gathering data
    \item Restructuring data
    \item Making an output
\end{itemize}
